This is my hello world post...

<!-- more -->

I used to have a static generated website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Now I wanted to start fresh and take advantage of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

But: Github Pages utilizes [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as static site generator. Although I played a little bit with Jekyll, I never grew fond of it and its templating engine. Since I wanted to play with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as well, I see this site as a POC.

I used following tutorials for my approach:
* https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
* https://ruddra.com/hugo-deploy-static-page-using-github-actions/
