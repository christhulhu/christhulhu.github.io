My name is Christian Gehlen. I was born in 1985 and live near Aachen, Germany. I'm a Software-Developer since 2006. Although I work with Java as my primary language, I grew fond of other languages like Python as well. Since 2020 I also fulfil the role as Product Manager for several applications in the telco business. 

I'm a specialist for number portability (LNP, MNP, SNP) in Germany, have deep knowledge about technical specifications as TMF OpenAPI, TR-AAV and I'm an expert about the provider change processes of the German market (WBCI, S/PRI, WITA).

Currently I help my customers with their IT transformations. Moving applications into the cloud (AWS), deployment of applications with Docker or on Kubernetes and elevate old SOAP APIs to RESTful microservices. 

This about section will be more detailed in the future. But if you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:chr.schmitz01@gmail.com)!
