My name is Christian Gehlen. I was born in 1985 and live near Aachen, Germany. I'm a Software-Developer since 2006 and Product Manager since 2020.

I'm a tech generalist that understands complex situations from source code, network layers, database models, container setups to business processes and user experience. Clean structures, versioning and task management are my strength ðŸ’ª

{{< card title="What I Do" >}}
I'm a specialist for processes of the German telecommunication market. From regal requirements to official specifications and individual requirements, I have a deep understanding of the needs of my customers.

My role is to understand the requirements of my clients, shape them into an ubiquitous understanding of the problem and the potential solution and transform them into atomic tasks for a small development team. In agile cycles I am in close contact to special interest groups, my customers and my fellow developers to ensure the quality of my products.

{{< card title="My competences" >}}
With my background as software developer I am able to review code, understand the technical approaches and define a task on a granular level. As part of my daily business I understand the challenges and opportunities of the DevOps methodology. And in my role as Product Manager, I see the necessity of good documentation.

Everything can be handled as code. Source Code, infrastructure, deployments, documentation. Minify repeating tasks by automation. Keep track of changes with source code management. Keep your work documented. Not only for other but for your self. Your own code will look unfamiliar in two weeks.

Keep track of your tasks. Break up bigger tasks into smaller chunks. Abstract big problems into smaller challenges.

{{< card title="My Interests" >}}
**My Home**: My wife, my cat and myself bought an old house in 2022. Since this day almost all spare time is spend in renovations, restoration of old furniture or in the garden. A house is never finished...

**Gym**: With a job in front of a desk, sport is the best counterpart for both my spine and my mental health. So I regularly hit the gym twice a week.

**Music**: Music is my life. Aside from listening to music while coding or doing household chores, I play bass in a band with rehearsals once a week and occasional gigs.

**Tech**: I know, I have a profession in tech. But in my leisure time I'm still interested in news, current development or technologies. From trying new languages to orchestrating container to implementing a smart home to just reading news in magazines or on twitter.

**My Family**: Spending time with my family is very important. This starts with everyday cooking with my wife, playing with my cat or going for a hike together on the weekends.
