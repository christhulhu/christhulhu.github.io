  - title: Domain Driven Designed Mediation plattform
    roles:
      - developer
      - business analyst
    description: |-
      In the landscape of German telecommunication processes, there exist various SOAP-based interfaces, many of which employ X.509 webservice security policies. Numerous customers utilize one of these interfaces to deliver services to a multitude of clients.
      To address this requirement, I played a crucial role in developing a versatile mediation and routing platform. This platform possesses the capability to enhance, route, encrypt messages for several protocols, and manage reporting and retries. Some of the supported protocols include, but are not limited to:
      * WBCI (WITA Based Carrier Interface, negotiation for provider change)
      * WITA (Wholesale platform of Deutsche Telekom AG)
      * S/PRI (Supplier/Partner Requisition Interface, Wholesale/Wholebuy for fiber lines)
      * TR-AAV (Technische Richtlinie für das Automatisierte Auskunftsverfahren, legal requirement for law enforcement)

      The WITA Based Carrier Interface was created to replace the outdated analog fax process for provider change. A crucial component of the specification was the necessity for an official certification of the interface implementation.
      I played a pivotal role in the development team tasked with implementing a domain-driven architecture using CQRS patterns and facilitating messaging between the components of this application. My responsibility extended to obtaining official certification for our application. To streamline and ensure the quality assurance of our application, I automated the certification process, making it reproducible and testable.
