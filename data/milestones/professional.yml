      As one of my customers switched his routing of mobile calls from service to his own routing, I implemented a complete and qualified set of routing data based on the official zMRDB by MNP GbR.

  - title: Domain Driven Designed Mediation plattform
    roles:
      - developer
      - business analyst
    description: |-
      There are several SOAP-based interfaces for processes of the German telecommunication market. Many of them use X.509 webservice security policies. And many of our customers use one of their interface to provide service for a number of clients.
      To fulfil this needs, I was part of the development of a generic mediation and routing platform that is capable of enriching, routing, encrypting, of messages for several protocols as well as taking care of reportings and retries.
      Some - but not all - of the protocols that are supported by this mediation platform are:
      * WBCI (WITA Based Carrier Interface, negotiation for provider change)
      * WITA (Wholesale platform of Deutsche Telekom AG)
      * S/PRI (Supplier/Partner Requisition Interface, Wholesale/Wholebuy for fiber lines)
      * TR-AAV (Technische Richtlinie für das Automatisierte Auskunftsverfahren, legal requirement for law enforcement)

  - title: Implementation and certification of a WBCI compliant application
    roles:
      - developer
    description: |- 
      The WITA Based Carrier Interface was designed to substitute the old, analogue fax process for provider change. Part of the specification was the requirement of an official certification of the interface implementation. 
      I was part of the development team that implemented a domain driven architecture using CQRS patterns and messaging between the components of this application. 
      I was responsible to get our application officially certified. So I automated the process to have a reproduceable and testable quality assurance for our application.
