  title: Modernization of Legacy Application
  description: |-
    I lead the modernization of a legacy SOAP Application into a state-of-the-art RESTful microservice. The APIs based on the standards for TMF OpenAPI. 
    For implementation in Backend Apache Karaf and Apache Camel were utilized. The infrastructure uses AWS standards and WSO2 as API-Gateway.
    My job in this project was the communication with our customer, to understand his requirements and translate them in atomic tasks for our development team. As part of this role I was the representative stake holder in the agile development and took care of all documentation.

    I am responsible for an business application that used Java 8 and Payarafish 5 as runtime environment. With the announcement of the EOL of Payarafish 5, radical renovation was necessary. So I shifted the code basis form JDK 8 to JDK 11.

  title: Domain Driven Designed Mediation plattform
  description: |-
    There are several SOAP-based interfaces for processes of the German telecommunication market. Many of them use X.509 webservice security policies. And many of our customers use one of their interface to provide service for a number of clients.
    To fulfil this needs, I was part of the development of a generic mediation and routing platform that is capable of enriching, routing, encrypting, of messages for several protocols as well as taking care of reportings and retries.
    Some - but not all - of the protocols that are supported by this mediation platform are:
    * WBCI (WITA Based Carrier Interface, negotiation for provider change)
    * WITA (Wholesale platform of Deutsche Telekom AG)
    * S/PRI (Supplier/Partner Requisition Interface, Wholesale/Wholebuy for fiber lines)
    * TR-AAV (Technische Richtlinie für das Automatisierte Auskunftsverfahren, legal requirement for law enforcement)

  title: Lead Development for the implementation of German PDA Specification v17

    With the implementation of the PDA 17 specification I took the role as lead developer as well as product manager to specify the requirements to my fellow developers .

  title: Implementation and certification of a WBCI compliant application
  description: |- 
    The WITA Based Carrier Interface was designed to substitute the old, analogue fax process for provider change. Part of the specification was the requirement of an official certification of the interface implementation. 
    I was part of the development team that implemented a domain driven architecture using CQRS patterns and messaging between the components of this application. 
    I was responsible to get our application officially certified. So I automated the process to have a reproduceable and testable quality assurance for our application.
