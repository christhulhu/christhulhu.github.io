      Centipedes, despite being intriguing creatures, are not widely popular, with limited scientific research dedicated to them. Moreover, information on keeping these animals in a terrarium is scarce. Drawing on my experience of maintaining centipedes from 2004 to 2011, I decided to revive this hobby in late 2023.

      In an effort to share knowledge and fill the gap in available information, I initiated a project to create a website dedicated to these obscure yet fascinating creatures. Currently, the project is still in development, with both the [source code](https://github.com/christhulhu/scolohub.com) and [hosting](https://scolohub.com/) accessible on GitHub. I encourage anyone with an interest to actively participate in this collaborative endeavor, contributing to the growing repository of knowledge on centipedes and their care in captivity.

      [scolohub.com](https://scolohub.com/) has been constructed using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

      In 2022, my wife and I embarked on the journey of purchasing an old house. While I had some prior experience in crafting, this project pushed me to a new level of DIY expertise. Together, we undertook a comprehensive range of tasks, from laying new floors to replacing wallpaper with finer finishes, addressing wall issues, and concealing cables beneath the finishes. As the summer arrived, a significant portion of our efforts shifted to the garden, spanning an expansive 700m². Our goal was to create a space that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also serves as a conducive habitat for local wildlife, including birds, hedgehogs, squirrels and a diverse array of insects and other arthropods.

      I am the bassist and backing vocalist for the black metal band Ius Talionis based in Aachen, Germany. My role involves crafting bass lines that not only provide a solid foundation with the drums but also serve as a bridge to complement the guitar melodies. Employing a finger-style playing technique, I incorporate additional methods such as slapping and tapping to enhance the musical dynamics. Currently, our upcoming album is in the recording phase, with drums and bass already captured in a live session. Presently, the guitars are being recorded as overdubs to finalize the production.

      I undertook the design and implementation of the website and online store for the German underground music label, Lycanthropic Chants. The backend is powered by WordPress as the Content Management System (CMS), utilizing WooCommerce for the shop functionality along with additional plugins for managing digital download codes. The frontend was developed using the Bones framework.

      Musical preferences can evolve over time. While my enduring love for death metal and grindcore remains, I've also discovered the allure of various other dark musical genres. Much of this new exploration didn't quite align with the theme of NecroSlaughter.de, predominantly encompassing black metal and other genres that defy easy categorization beyond being described as "dark, gloomy, pale". In response, I decided to launch an additional webzine dedicated exclusively to this eclectic range of music. Although its existence was relatively brief, lasting around two years, remnants of the webzine persist on [Github](https://github.com/christhulhu/thenocturnalsilence) in its original form as a statically generated Hugo site. Its final testament was a printed edition featuring selected interviews, preserving a snapshot of its dynamic and diverse musical journey.

      I was responsible for the design and execution of the website for the doom/death metal band Cryptic Brood based in Wolfsburg, Germany. The backend functionality is powered by WordPress as the Content Management System (CMS), complemented by BuddyPress to serve as an internal forum for the band. The frontend was crafted using Bootstrap for a seamless and responsive user experience.

      Grindcore may not be widely recognized as a conventional musical genre, but when even John Peel appreciates its appeal, it surely holds some merit. I dedicated a decade to playing bass in a Grindcore band. Unusual for this genre, I employed fingerstyle techniques, incorporating elements like slapping, and utilized a five-string bass. Our journey included the release of several albums and splits, and we performed at various gigs across Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and the Czech Republic.

      My initial venture into official projects was Necroslaughter.de, an online fanzine dedicated to extreme metal music and grindcore. In the early stages, I manually curated the site, creating HTML pages and utilizing a .tk-domain. Around 2006, I transitioned to WordPress as a CMS, developing custom themes and plugins to cater to specific requirements, and eventually adopting the final NecroSlaughter.de-domain. Following the site's conclusion, I safeguarded its content using Python scripts and preserved it in a format conducive to regeneration through the static site generator Hugo.
