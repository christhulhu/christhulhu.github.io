    Not many people would consider Grindcore a musical genre. But if even John Peel was fond of this style, it can't be that bad. I played bass in this band for 10 years, released a couple of Albums and Splits and had several gigs in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Czech Republic.

  title: NecroSlaughter.de
  description: |-
    My first real official project. Way before CMS systems became popular I manually maintained an online fanzine / webzine about death metal and Grindcore. About 2006 I switched to Wordpress as CMS, wrote custom themes and plugins to fulfil my needs. After its funeral, I preserved its content with some python-scripts to be regenerated with the static site generator Hugo. You can find everything on [Github](https://github.com/christhulhu/necroslaughter).

    Sometimes musical taste changes. Although I am still very fond of death metal and grindcore, I discovered the beauty of other dark musical genres. Most of this music did not fit into the concept of NecroSlaughter.de. Most of it was black metal, other did not really fit into other categories than "dark, gloomy, pale". So I decided to run another, excessive webzine for this kind of music. It only lasted about two years. Meanwhile its remains are sill available on [Github](https://github.com/christhulhu/thenocturnalsilence) in its original form as static generated Hugo site, the final sign of live was a printed edition of some selected interviews.
