I&rsquo;ve been working as a Software Developer since 2006 and took on the role of Product Manager in 2020.</p><div class=card><div class=card-header><div class=card-title>tl;dr</div></div><div class=card-text>I consider myself a tech generalist with a comprehensive understanding of intricate scenarios, spanning from source code, network layers, and database models to container setups, business processes, and user experience. My strengths lie in maintaining clean structures, proficient versioning, and effective task management. ðŸ’ª</div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header><div class=card-title>What I Do</div></div><div class=card-text><p>I specialize in the processes within the German telecommunications market. Whether dealing with regulatory requirements, official specifications, or individual needs, I possess a profound understanding of my customers&rsquo; demands.</p><p>In my role, I strive to comprehend my clients&rsquo; requirements, distill them into a universally understood problem and potential solution, and then break them down into granular tasks for a compact development team. Throughout agile cycles, I maintain close communication with special interest groups, customers, and fellow developers to uphold the quality of the products I deliver.</p></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header><div class=card-title>My competences</div></div><div class=card-text><p>Drawing on my background as a software developer, I possess the ability to scrutinize code, comprehend technical approaches, and define tasks at a granular level. In my daily responsibilities, I am well-versed in the challenges and opportunities presented by the DevOps methodology. As a Product Manager, I recognize the crucial role of thorough documentation.</p><p>I firmly believe that everything can be managed as code â€” whether it&rsquo;s source code, infrastructure, deployments, or documentation. By automating repetitive tasks, we can streamline processes. Source code management allows us to monitor changes effectively. Documentation is not only essential for others but also for oneself, as our own code can seem unfamiliar after just a short time.</p><p>To stay organized, it&rsquo;s crucial to keep track of tasks. Breaking down larger tasks into smaller chunks and abstracting big problems into manageable challenges are effective strategies. This approach ensures clarity and facilitates more efficient problem-solving.</p><p>For more details, please refer to my <a href=/skills>hard skills</a>.</p></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header><div class=card-title>My Interests</div></div><div class=card-text><p><strong>My Home</strong>: In 2022, my wife, my cat, and I purchased an old house. Since then, nearly all our free time has been dedicated to renovations, restoring vintage furniture, and tending to the garden. As the saying goes, a house is a project that&rsquo;s never truly finished.</p><p><strong>Centipedes</strong>:
I&rsquo;m deeply fascinated by giant centipedes. While part of my interest involves keeping and breeding these creatures, the real enjoyment comes from delving into the realm of research on these obscure animals. Given the limited knowledge available, I&rsquo;ve taken the initiative to create a dedicated website for fellow enthusiasts, serving as a hub for information and shared interest in these remarkable creatures: <a href=https://scolohub.com>scolohub.com</a></p><p><strong>Gym</strong>: Working at a desk all day, I find that engaging in sports is the ideal counterbalance for both my spine and mental well-being. Consequently, I make it a habit to visit the gym twice a week.</p><p><strong>Music</strong>: My life revolves around music. Whether I&rsquo;m coding, doing household chores, or engaged in other activities, there&rsquo;s always music playing. Additionally, I play bass in a band, with weekly rehearsals and occasional gigs adding a dynamic rhythm to my musical journey.</p><p><strong>Tech</strong>: While I do have a professional background in tech, my leisure time is still filled with a keen interest in news, current developments, and technologies. Whether it&rsquo;s experimenting with new programming languages, orchestrating containers, implementing smart home solutions, or simply staying updated through magazines and X/Twitter, my enthusiasm for technology extends beyond the confines of my professional life.</p><p><strong>My Family</strong>: Prioritizing time with my family holds significant importance for me. This includes daily cooking sessions with my wife, engaging in playtime with my cats, and embarking on weekend hikes together.</p></div></div></p></div></div></main></body></html>
